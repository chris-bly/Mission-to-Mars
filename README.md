# Mission-to-Mars
The objective of this challennge was to update the previously scraped and presented Mars data with additional high-resolution images of Mars along with adding Bootstrap 3 components for viewing flexibility across multiple devices.

## Results
### Deliverable 1
Full-resolution images of Mars' hemispheres along with their titles were scraped and stored in the Mongo Database.

### Deliverable 2
The web app developed in the asynchronous content was updated with the full-resolution images, which required changes to the index.html file to ensure all content could be viewed properly on the web app.

### Deliverable 3
Boostrap components were added to ensure the app would properly render for multiple different devices and formats using the Bootstrap 3 Grid System. In addition, an image of a Mars landscape was added to the scrape button banner atop the website , as well as thumbnails and links to the full resolution images of Mars' hemispheres to satisfy the requirements of this deliverable.

The following is a screengrab of how the site appears with scraped data and retrieved from the Mongo database:
